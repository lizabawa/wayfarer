## Features



## Project Approach 

### User-Centric Design


 
### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
To model our data structure effectively, we've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This visual representation maps out the relationships between different entities in our system, such as users, albums, and photos. The ERD serves as a blueprint for our database design, ensuring that data is organized and structured efficiently.
